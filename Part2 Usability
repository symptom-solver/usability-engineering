As the final segment of our SaMD project, we will delve into the crucial aspects of usability engineering as applied to Symptomsolver, our innovative medical software designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care. In this section, we ensure that Symptomsolver adheres to all usability principles stipulated by ISO 62366, emphasizing effectiveness, safety, and user satisfaction.

Usability engineering entails designing intuitive and efficient products. For Symptomsolver, this translates into creating a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that facilitate accurate diagnosis and seamless interaction for healthcare providers. The development of Symptomsolver's UI/UX design incorporated extensive stakeholder feedback and observational studies. We emphasized minimizing cognitive load and ensuring usability across different environments and user skill levels during testing sessions with representative users. Testing protocols included measuring functional errors and assessing user satisfaction.

Integration of usability engineering with risk management practices is pivotal. We identified and analyzed hazards associated with Symptomsolver's UI interactions using methods such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Subsequently, we implemented design improvements to mitigate identified risks effectively. Our approach is aligned with ISO 62366 standards, ensuring that all usability activities meet stringent regulatory requirements for medical software.

Post-market surveillance remains integral to Symptomsolver's lifecycle management. It enables continuous gathering of user feedback and monitoring of usability issues in real-world clinical and medical settings, facilitating ongoing refinement and enhancement of the software.

By placing a strategic emphasis on usability engineering, Symptomsolver not only enhances diagnostic accuracy and user satisfaction but also mitigates potential usability-related risks in healthcare settings. Our steadfast commitment to delivering safe, effective, and user-friendly medical software solutions is exemplified through Symptomsolver's adherence to ISO 62366 standards.

Detailed Insights into Usability Testing Processes for Symptomsolver
Use Specification
The USE SPECIFICATION for Symptomsolver, prepared in accordance with IEC 62366 chapter 5.1, includes the following elements:

Intended Medical Indication:

Symptomsolver is designed to screen and diagnose infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, flu, common cold, bronchitis, and RSV, based on user-reported symptoms.
Intended Patient Population:

Age Group: All age groups (children, adults, elderly).
Health Condition: Patients experiencing symptoms related to the aforementioned infectious diseases.
Weight Range: No specific weight range; applicable to all individuals.
Intended Part of the Body or Type of Tissue Applied to or Interacted With:

As Symptomsolver is a software application, interaction is with the user interface rather than a specific body part.
Intended User Profile:

Users: General public, including patients and healthcare providers.
Skills: Basic knowledge of operating a mobile device or computer; no specialized medical knowledge required.
Use Environment:

Environment: Usable in home settings, clinics, and hospitals.
Conditions: Accessible via mobile device or computer with internet connectivity.
Operating Principle:

The user inputs symptoms into the application, and Symptomsolver calculates the probabilities of different diseases based on predefined symptom-disease correlations. The result is presented as the most probable disease.
Plan for Usability Tests
Selection of Processes to be Tested:
Symptom Input: Testing the ease with which users can input their symptoms.
Reason: High probability of error if the input process is not intuitive, leading to incorrect diagnoses.
Result Interpretation: Testing whether users can easily understand and interpret the diagnosis results provided by Symptomsolver.
Reason: Critical for user satisfaction and correct subsequent actions based on diagnosis.
Description of the Tests:

Structure:
Symptom Input Test: Users will be asked to input a set of symptoms into the application.
Result Interpretation Test: Users will be presented with a diagnosis result and asked to interpret it.
Selection of Testers:
Symptom Input Test: 5 users from different age groups and technical backgrounds.
Result Interpretation Test: 5 users from the intended patient population.
Procedure:
Symptom Input Test:
Provide users with a list of symptoms to input.
Observe and record the time taken and any difficulties encountered.
Result Interpretation Test:
Present users with a sample diagnosis result.
Ask users to explain their understanding of the result.
Record their interpretations and any confusion or errors.
Criteria for Passing the Tests:

Symptom Input Test: 90% of users should be able to input symptoms correctly without assistance.
Result Interpretation Test: 90% of users should correctly interpret the diagnosis result.
Summative Usability Test
Testing with Actual Product or Prototype:

Prototype: Testing will be conducted using a functional prototype of the Symptomsolver application.
Testers:

Number of Testers: 2 users who are not part of the development team.
Protocol of the Usability Test:

Symptom Input Test Protocol:

Objective: To evaluate the ease of inputting symptoms.
Participants: 2 users.
Procedure: Users will be given a list of symptoms to input into the application. Observers will note the time taken and any issues faced.
Data Collection: Time taken, errors made, user feedback.
Results: Document the findings, analyze the data, and identify areas for improvement.
Result Interpretation Test Protocol:

Objective: To evaluate the clarity of the diagnosis result.
Participants: 2 users.
Procedure: Users will be shown a sample diagnosis result and asked to explain it. Observers will note their understanding and any confusion.
Data Collection: User interpretations, errors in understanding, user feedback.
Results: Document the findings, analyze the data, and identify areas for improvement.
Filing Results:

The results of the usability tests will be documented and filed according to the QM system. This includes the test protocols, user feedback, data collected, analysis, and identified improvements.
In summary, by adhering to the principles of usability engineering as per ISO 62366, Symptomsolver is poised to deliver a user-friendly, safe, and effective diagnostic tool for patients and healthcare providers. Our rigorous approach to usability testing ensures that the software meets high standards of functionality and user satisfaction, ultimately enhancing patient care and diagnostic accuracy.
