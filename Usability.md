# Usability Engineering Report for Symptomsolver

## Introduction
As the final segment of our SaMD project, we will delve into the crucial aspects of usability engineering as applied to Symptomsolver, our innovative medical software designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care. In this section, we ensure that Symptomsolver adheres to all usability principles stipulated by ISO 62366, emphasizing effectiveness, safety, and user satisfaction.

## Usability Engineering Principles
Usability engineering entails designing intuitive and efficient products. For Symptomsolver, this translates into creating a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that facilitate accurate diagnosis and seamless interaction for healthcare providers. The development of Symptomsolver's UI/UX design incorporated extensive stakeholder feedback and observational studies. We emphasized minimizing cognitive load and ensuring usability across different environments and user skill levels during testing sessions with representative users. Testing protocols included measuring functional errors and assessing user satisfaction.

## Integration with Risk Management
Integration of usability engineering with risk management practices is pivotal. We identified and analyzed hazards associated with Symptomsolver's UI interactions using methods such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Subsequently, we implemented design improvements to mitigate identified risks effectively. Our approach is aligned with ISO 62366 standards, ensuring that all usability activities meet stringent regulatory requirements for medical software.

## Post-Market Surveillance
Post-market surveillance remains integral to Symptomsolver's lifecycle management. It enables continuous gathering of user feedback and monitoring of usability issues in real-world clinical and medical settings, facilitating ongoing refinement and enhancement of the software.
