# Usability Engineering Report for Symptomsolver

## Introduction
As the final segment of our SaMD project, we will delve into the crucial aspects of usability engineering as applied to Symptomsolver, our innovative medical software designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care. In this section, we ensure that Symptomsolver adheres to all usability principles stipulated by ISO 62366, emphasizing effectiveness, safety, and user satisfaction.

## Usability Engineering Principles
Usability engineering entails designing intuitive and efficient products. For Symptomsolver, this translates into creating a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that facilitate accurate diagnosis and seamless interaction for healthcare providers. The development of Symptomsolver's UI/UX design incorporated extensive stakeholder feedback and observational studies. We emphasized minimizing cognitive load and ensuring usability across different environments and user skill levels during testing sessions with representative users. Testing protocols included measuring functional errors and assessing user satisfaction.

## Integration with Risk Management
Integration of usability engineering with risk management practices is pivotal. We identified and analyzed hazards associated with Symptomsolver's UI interactions using methods such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Subsequently, we implemented design improvements to mitigate identified risks effectively. Our approach is aligned with ISO 62366 standards, ensuring that all usability activities meet stringent regulatory requirements for medical software.

## Post-Market Surveillance
Post-market surveillance remains integral to Symptomsolver's lifecycle management. It enables continuous gathering of user feedback and monitoring of usability issues in real-world clinical and medical settings, facilitating ongoing refinement and enhancement of the software.

## Summative Usability Test
A summative usability test was conducted as a practical part of this project:

### Test Objective:
To gather quantitative and qualitative data on the usability of Symptomsolver.

### Methodology:
Users performed the specific tasks outlined in the usability testing plan under observation. Their interactions were recorded and analyzed.

### Results:
The results indicated areas of strength and opportunities for improvement, which informed subsequent design iterations.

## Usability Test for Symptomsolver

### Objective

To evaluate the usability of Symptomsolver by testing the ease of symptom input and the clarity of diagnosis result interpretation with three participants.

### Participants

1. **Participant A:** 35-year-old female, moderate technical skills, uses mobile devices daily.
2. **Participant B:** 50-year-old male, low technical skills, occasional computer user.
3. **Participant C:** 28-year-old female, high technical skills, frequent user of both mobile devices and computers.

### Test Setup

**Environment:**
- Tests conducted remotely using video conferencing to observe interactions.

**Tools:**
- Functional prototype of Symptomsolver.
- Screen recording software to capture interactions.

### Test Procedure

#### Symptom Input Test

1. **Instructions:**
   - Participants are given a list of five symptoms to input into Symptomsolver.
   - They are asked to perform the task as quickly and accurately as possible.

2. **Observation Criteria:**
   - Time taken to input symptoms.
   - Any difficulties or errors encountered.
   - User feedback on the input process.

#### Result Interpretation Test

1. **Instructions:**
   - Participants are shown a sample diagnosis result generated by Symptomsolver.
   - They are asked to explain their understanding of the result.

2. **Observation Criteria:**
   - Clarity of the diagnosis result.
   - Any confusion or misinterpretation.
   - User feedback on the clarity and usefulness of the result.

### Results

#### Participant A

**Symptom Input Test:**
- Time Taken: 2 minutes.
- Difficulties: None.

- Confusion: None.
- Feedback: "The result was clear and informative."

#### Participant B

**Symptom Input Test:**
- Time Taken: 3.5 minutes.
- Difficulties: Slight difficulty finding the input fields.
- Errors: One typo corrected.
- Feedback: "It was a bit challenging at first, but I got used to it quickly."

**Result Interpretation Test:**
- Understanding: Correctly identified the most probable disease but was slightly confused by the technical terms.
