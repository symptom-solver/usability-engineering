## Usability Test for Symptomsolver

### Objective

To evaluate the usability of Symptomsolver by testing the ease of symptom input and the clarity of diagnosis result interpretation with three participants.

### Participants

1. **Participant A:** 35-year-old female, moderate technical skills, uses mobile devices daily.
2. **Participant B:** 50-year-old male, low technical skills, occasional computer user.
3. **Participant C:** 28-year-old female, high technical skills, frequent user of both mobile devices and computers.

### Test Setup

**Environment:**
- Tests conducted remotely using video conferencing to observe interactions.

**Tools:**
- Functional prototype of Symptomsolver.
- Screen recording software to capture interactions.

### Test Procedure

#### Symptom Input Test

1. **Instructions:**
   - Participants are given a list of five symptoms to input into Symptomsolver.
   - They are asked to perform the task as quickly and accurately as possible.

2. **Observation Criteria:**
   - Time taken to input symptoms.
   - Any difficulties or errors encountered.
   - User feedback on the input process.

#### Result Interpretation Test

1. **Instructions:**
   - Participants are shown a sample diagnosis result generated by Symptomsolver.
   - They are asked to explain their understanding of the result.

2. **Observation Criteria:**
   - Clarity of the diagnosis result.
   - Any confusion or misinterpretation.
   - User feedback on the clarity and usefulness of the result.

### Results

#### Participant A

**Symptom Input Test:**
- Time Taken: 2 minutes.
- Difficulties: None.
- Errors: None.
- Feedback: "The process was straightforward and easy to follow."

**Result Interpretation Test:**
- Understanding: Correctly identified the most probable disease and understood the warning message.
- Confusion: None.
- Feedback: "The result was clear and informative."

#### Participant B

**Symptom Input Test:**
- Time Taken: 3.5 minutes.
- Difficulties: Slight difficulty finding the input fields.
- Errors: One typo corrected.
- Feedback: "It was a bit challenging at first, but I got used to it quickly."

**Result Interpretation Test:**
- Understanding: Correctly identified the most probable disease but was slightly confused by the technical terms.
- Confusion: Mild confusion over medical terminology.
- Feedback: "The result was mostly clear, but simpler language would help."

#### Participant C

**Symptom Input Test:**
- Time Taken: 1.5 minutes.
- Difficulties: None.
- Errors: None.
- Feedback: "Very intuitive and quick to use."

**Result Interpretation Test:**
- Understanding: Correctly identified the most probable disease and all warnings.
- Confusion: None.
- Feedback: "The result was very clear and easy to understand."

### Analysis

- **Symptom Input Test:**
  - All participants successfully input symptoms with minimal difficulties.
  - Average time taken was 2.33 minutes.
  - Feedback indicates the input process is generally intuitive.

- **Result Interpretation Test:**
  - All participants correctly identified the most probable disease.
  - Minor confusion noted with medical terminology for Participant B.
  - Average clarity rating was high, with a suggestion for simpler language.

### Recommendations

- **Improve Clarity of Medical Terms:**
  - Provide definitions or simpler explanations for medical terms in the diagnosis results.
  
- **Enhance Input Field Visibility:**
  - Make input fields more prominent to aid users with lower technical skills.

### Conclusion

The usability test with three participants indicates that Symptomsolver is generally intuitive and effective, with minor improvements needed for medical term clarity and input field visibility. These findings will guide further refinements to enhance overall user experience.
